You are working with me on a React + Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion project.

Do NOT guess or assume anything that isn’t explicitly defined.  
If something is unclear — ask before writing code.

Always follow best practices:
- Use strict TypeScript with explicit types for all props and state.
- Functional React components only (with hooks).
- Next.js App Router structure (app/ directory, not pages/).
- Add "use client" only where needed.
- Clean, focused, and well-named code.
- Use Next/Image and Next/Link where appropriate.
- Tailwind CSS only — no inline styles or plain CSS files.
- Do not create components, files, or logic I didn’t request.

If something isn’t defined — stop and ask first.
